### Project Description
[A daily-wear smart safety bracelet is proposed with an inbuilt SOS mechanism that sends emergency alerts and the user’s live location to registered contacts through SMS without requiring an internet connection. The device is designed to be energy-efficient by charging through daylight (solar energy) and ambient LED light, ensuring continuous operation. In the current implementation, the hardware functionality is simulated using a web application while maintaining the complete alert workflow.]

### The Problem statement
[In many emergency situations, especially those involving personal safety, victims are unable to quickly inform their family members, friends, or nearby authorities due to the unavailability of a fast, reliable, and easily accessible alert system. Most existing mobile-based safety solutions depend on smartphones and continuous internet connectivity, which may not always be available and can fail due to battery drain or network issues. Therefore, there is a need for a daily-wear, independent safety device that can instantly trigger an SOS alert, share the user’s live location through SMS without internet access, and operate using self-sustaining energy sources. This project addresses that need by proposing a smart safety bracelet with a simulated web-based SOS mechanism for real-time emergency communication.]

### The Solution
[The problem is addressed by designing a daily-wear smart safety bracelet with a one-press SOS feature that can instantly send emergency alerts and the user’s live location to pre-registered contacts and nearby authorities through SMS without requiring an internet connection. The device is planned to be self-sustaining using solar/daylight and ambient LED light charging for continuous availability. As the hardware implementation is currently not feasible, the complete functionality is simulated through a secure web application that includes user authentication, contact management, and an SOS button to demonstrate the real-time alert workflow.]
